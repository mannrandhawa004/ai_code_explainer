# AI Codebase Explainer

A production-oriented GenAI application for importing GitHub repositories, indexing source code, and answering natural-language questions with accurate file and line citations.

The implementation follows `AI-Codebase-Explainer-Complete-Project-Guide.md` in its stated development order. Each numbered step is implemented and reviewed separately before work begins on the next one.

## Architecture

```text
apps/web       Next.js frontend
apps/api       Express REST API
apps/worker    BullMQ indexing worker
packages/shared    Shared schemas, types, and constants
packages/ai        OpenAI embedding and generation services
packages/database  MongoDB models and database helpers
packages/vector-store  Qdrant client and collection lifecycle
packages/repository  Safe cloning and repository processing
packages/eslint-config  Shared lint configuration
docker         Container definitions
```

The two principal runtime workflows remain separated:

```text
Repository import -> queue -> worker -> parse/chunk -> embeddings -> Qdrant
Question -> hybrid retrieval -> grounded generation -> streamed cited answer
```

- [ ] 20. Add evaluations

## Current state

Step 14 adds the Next.js App Router frontend with a repository launcher, responsive conversation workspace, TanStack Query mutations, safe GitHub-flavored Markdown, lazy Shiki code highlighting, cited source cards, conversation continuation, cancellation/retry flows, and accessible loading and error states. The browser sends cookie-authenticated requests to the Step 13 endpoint and never accepts a client-provided identity.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or newer
- npm 10 or newer
- Git
- Docker Desktop (required beginning with the database/vector-storage steps)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` when configuration is introduced. Never commit `.env` or credentials.
