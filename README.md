# AI Codebase Explainer

A production-oriented GenAI application for importing GitHub repositories, indexing source code, and answering natural-language questions with accurate file and line citations.

The implementation follows `AI-Codebase-Explainer-Complete-Project-Guide.md` in its stated development order. Each numbered step is implemented and reviewed separately before work begins on the next one.

## Architecture

```text
apps/web       Next.js frontend
apps/api       Express REST API
apps/worker    BullMQ indexing worker
packages/shared    Shared schemas, types, and constants
packages/ai        OpenAI embedding and generation services
packages/database  MongoDB models and database helpers
packages/vector-store  Qdrant client and collection lifecycle
packages/repository  Safe cloning and repository processing
packages/eslint-config  Shared lint configuration
docker         Container definitions
```

The two principal runtime workflows remain separated:

```text
Repository import -> queue -> worker -> parse/chunk -> embeddings -> Qdrant
Question -> hybrid retrieval -> grounded generation -> streamed cited answer
```

- [ ] 20. Add evaluations

## Current state

Step 15 adds a typed BullMQ/Redis indexing queue and a separate worker that safely clones public repositories, filters and chunks source files, generates embeddings, stores vectors, and persists progress and results in MongoDB. The API now exposes authenticated import, reindex, status, cancellation, and Redis-health endpoints. Jobs use exponential retries, per-repository deduplication, cancellation checks, bounded concurrency, and graceful shutdown.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or newer
- npm 10 or newer
- Git
- Docker Desktop (required beginning with the database/vector-storage steps)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` when configuration is introduced. Never commit `.env` or credentials.

Start local infrastructure with `docker compose up -d`, then run the API and worker in separate terminals with `npm run dev --workspace @codebase-explainer/api` and `npm run dev --workspace @codebase-explainer/worker`. The Redis container is for local development; production should use a managed Redis service over `rediss://`.
